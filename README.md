# 🚀 Full Stack Internship Assignment Project

## 📌 Submission Overview

Thank you for the opportunity to work on this assignment.  
This project was developed within a **two-day timeline** to demonstrate my frontend and backend development skills.

I genuinely enjoyed building this project and applying my practical knowledge in a real-world scenario.

# 🌐 Project Overview

This is a full-stack web application built using React for the frontend and Node.js + Express for the backend, integrated with MongoDB.

The application includes:

- Real authentication system (Register & Login)
- JWT-based authorization
- Protected routes
- Multiple UI sections
- Backend API integration
- Dummy data rendering
- Clean responsive UI

The authentication backend was originally developed by me about one month ago and reused here to provide a realistic and secure login experience.

Due to the two-day time constraint, some sections include structured banner layouts instead of full functionality.
